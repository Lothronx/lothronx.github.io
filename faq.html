            </div>
            <p class="answer">
              Generally it can be said that there aren’t any restrictions for trading between China
              and South America, but it is better to look for information on any restrictions there
              might be imposed to your country by any other nation or prohibition on
              importing/exporting certain products from/to The shipping destination/origin. For
              example; it is internationally known that merchandise from countries in conflict is
              always difficult or not allowed to deal with, countries with restrictions from the US
              have it really difficult to export their products and when they find a buyer is almost
              impossible to find a shipping company willing to transport the cargo.

            <p class="answer">
              As currency of global use the USD is always welcomed as payment, but strong currencies
              like Euros and British Pound are sometimes welcomed too, it all depends on the
              arrangements you get to, with the buyer/seller, if you have the funds you might even
              be able to pay in CNY but it all depends on what the part who is receiving the funds
              is comfortable with.

              There are thousands of shipping companies transporting cargo daily from/to China and
              South America but it all the depends on the price, product, service and way of
              transport (Air and sea), that you’ll be needing for your cargo. Most of the time the
              seller ( when importing from China covers the shipping fee, but it may vary for
              different countries, seller and/or product).

            </div>
            <p class="answer">
              It all depends on how fast the seller arrange the cargo for its shipping after that
              you’ll have to consider where it has been shipped from if it is from China some times
              your cargo can get stuck in the port for days if the seller didn’t have all the
              documents in order but it almost never happens you’ll have to consider the are
              millions of containers being shipped out of China on a daily basis, if you’re shipping
              off South America then you’ll know all the things that can and can not happen if you
              don’t have everything in other and arrange it all with a good shipping company. The
              total air-cargo transit time between South America and China can vary from 8 to 15
              days it all depends which country you’re shipping from and I if it is Ocean freight it
              could take from six weeks to several more.

              You will have to take in consideration the address of the buyer and where do they want
              to receive the cargo and your capability and/or the shipping agency’s to deliver the
              cargo to the desired destination, if the buyer will be in charge of the shipping then
              it will be less trouble for the seller. If you’re the buyer remember to always clearly
              specify where do you want to receive your goods and to ask the seller or shipping
              company if they are in willing to deliver to you country. (Don’t forget the
              restrictions).

            <p class="answer">
              Of course you will have to have all the documents related to your cargo on hand ready
              to be given to customs ( sanitary documents, purchasing bills, certificates of
              origin…) different documents are needed for different cargoes, you will probably have
              to go through a cargo inspection too. It is always a good Idea to hire a good customs
              agent if you don’t have the time to deal with this, they could be a little expensive
              but if they are professionals you will have your goods at your door in no time.

              It is important to always check the specifications of the product you are buying you
              will not want to buy a “ phone” and then get just a “phone case“ , take a look at the
              reviews of the shop it will give you and Idea of what you’re getting into.

            </div>
            <p class="answer">
              Do not forget to always ask the seller for its business license there you will find a
              number and a QR code that you can scan and it will take you to the website of the
              National Enterprise Credit Information if the website is working well, then you’ll be
              able to type the company’s name or identification number and you’ll be able to see if
              they’re in a black list or not if there is not information appearing it is always good
              to go to the provincial credit administration website type in the name and all the
              needed info will be shown.
