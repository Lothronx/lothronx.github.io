        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          My initial reaction after reading the coursework brief was that I didn't want to create a fictional website
          only to finish the coursework; instead, I wanted to build a website that people could truly use in their real
          lives. I asked around my friends who might need a simple website. A Hispanic friend of mine who currently
          lives in China replied and said, he could use one. After speaking with him about his user requirements and
          taking the course rubrics into consideration, I decided to create a website with a China-LAC trade theme.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both being part of the global south, China and Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) have a long
          history of mutual affinity. Within the past 20 years, their business relationship has multiplied 26-fold. Many
          ambitious young Latin Americans (like my friend) are moving to China to advance their personal development.
          Numerous aspirational small Chinese businesses are also looking for chances to explore the international
          market. However, the sad reality is that, while one can easily get a lot of material online about trade
          between China and the US and between LAC and the US, one can scarcely find many useful China-LAC trade
          information, as neither China nor LAC countries is frequently portrayed as the proactive hero in any
          commercial storytelling. Lack of information could result in the loss of important possibilities, particularly
          for young entrepreneurs and small enterprises with limited resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, the main objective of my website is to disseminate the most fundamental information about the China-LAC
          trade. The slogan of the website is “build a bridge between China and Latin America”, with the hope that more
          adventurous young businesspeople will see the bridge and cross it to explore a colorful whole new world on the
          other side of the Earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for my friend, who is launching his own trade consulting business, a website with quality, substantial
          material will be helpful to him as well, because content marketing has grown increasingly important in the
          contemporary consulting profession.
        </p>
        <p>
          The website comprises of 5 pages: the home page, a whitepaper page, a news page, a FAQ page, and a contact
          page. Whitepaper page covers the basic facts about China-LAC trade, including market size, typical imports and
          exports of goods, and the trading process. News page features the latest trade news. FAQ page lists 8
          questions newcomers frequently ask. Contact page includes the company’s details as well as a contact form.
          Homepage serves as the landing page and a preview of the four other pages.

              This book details the author's personal experience creating a brand from scratch and introduces his unique
              content marketing methodology. I understood the value of content marketing from this book, and I also
              learned the dos and don'ts of it. I learned that producing and disseminating valuable, pertinent, and
              consistent content helps to build a solid, long-term, mutually beneficial relationship with your target
              users.

            <p>
              I am not familiar with the business consulting industry, so I first had no idea what to put on a trade
              consulting website or where to begin. To find inspiration, I looked up official websites of consulting
              firms online and looked for those well-designed ones. Carson International's website is current and
              stylish. I analyzed its website structure as well as its design approaches and partially applied them to
              my own website.

            <p>
              I primarily consulted this analytical research to deepen my knowledge of the trade between China and the
              LAC region. From the author's thorough analysis, I learned about China-LAC trade history in the past 20
              years, their current trade relations, and their potentials for the near future and the implications.

        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Keyboard accessibility</h3>
            <p>
              This website supports keyboard accessibility. Each clickable link, button, and major article component can
              be tabbed. Keyboard compatibility is also included into features like responsive hamburger menus and
              dropdown lists. The entire website can be navigated by a user without the usage of a mouse.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Link accessiility</h3>
            <p>
              Underlined links are important for low-vision users' accessibility. This website support link highlight
              mode. On link highlight mode, all clickable links are underlined, stressing their existence on the
              webpage.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Low contrast mode</h3>
            <p>
              Low contrast mode is supported on this website. Color is displayed differently on different devices.
              Additionally, users see color differently. High-contrast, bright colors are used on this wedbsite, which
              some users using particular devices might feel "too much". As a result, the website provides a low
              contrast mode to suit various requirements.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Image alt attribute</h3>
            <p>
              Additionally, all images on this website have alt attribute and are accessible to screen reader users
              (persons with visual impairments).
            </p>

      <section id="usability">
        <h2>Usability</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Scroll-to-top button</h3>
            <p>
              This website has a seamless scroll-to-top animation and a scroll-to-top button in the bottom right corner
              of every page. Users can swiftly yet smoothly return to the top of the page thanks to this feature. The
              only exception is the home page, because "the button does not look good there". As a substitute, I offered a
              sidebar fixed to the right, which also allows easy navigation but with a more stylish look.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Hide the navigation bar on scroll</h3>
            <p>
              On small touchscreens (such as mobile phones), the menu bar will automatically disappear when the user
              scrolls up. Since viewports on mobile devices can have relatively small sizes, it is beneficial to give as
              much room as possible for the primary content. The menu bar will reappear when the user scrolls down or
              tabs the screen, making it easy for them to access it the way they are accustomed to doing so whenever
              they need it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Avoid big blocks of text</h3>
            <p>
              Despite the fact that the most of the content research I conducted for this website involved dense
              material, this website purposefully avoided using big blocks of text by employing infographics ("Start
              Your Import/Export Business in 6 Steps") and segmenting lengthy text into shorter paragraphs ("About us").
              This improves the website's overall readability.

              and Chinese speaking populations are the major target users of this website.
