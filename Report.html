      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        My initial reaction after reading the coursework brief was that I didn't want to create a fictional website only
        to finish the coursework; instead, I wanted to build a website that people could truly use in their real lives.
        I asked around my friends who might need a simple website. A Hispanic friend of mine who currently lives in China
        replied and said, he could use one. After speaking with him about his user requirements and taking the course
        rubrics into consideration, I decided to create a website with a China-LAC trade theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both being part of the global south, China and Latin America and the Caribbean countries (LAC) have a long history of
        mutual affinity. Within the past 20 years, their business relationship has multiplied 26-fold. Many ambitious
        young Latin Americans (like my friend) are moving to China to advance their personal development. Numerous
        aspirational small Chinese businesses are also looking for chances to explore the international market. However,
        the sad reality is that, while one can easily get a lot of material online about trade between China and the US
        and between LAC and the US, one can scarcely find many useful China-LAC trade information, as neither China nor
        LAC countries is frequently portrayed as the proactive hero in any commercial storytelling. Lack of information
        could result in the loss of important possibilities, particularly for young entrepreneurs and small enterprises
        with limited resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the main objective of my website is to disseminate the most fundamental information about the China-LAC
        trade. The slogan of the website is “build a bridge between China and Latin America”, with the hope that more
        adventurous young businesspeople will see the bridge and cross it to explore a colorful whole new world on the
        other side of the Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for my friend, who is launching his own trade consulting business, a website with quality, substantial
        material will be helpful to him as well, because content marketing has grown increasingly important in the
        contemporary consulting profession.
      </p>
      <p>
        The website comprises of 5 pages: the home page, a whitepaper page, a news page, a FAQ page, and a contact page.
        Whitepaper page covers the basic facts about China-LAC trade, including market size, typical imports and exports
        of goods, and the trading process. News page features the latest trade news. FAQ page lists 8 questions
        newcomers frequently ask. Contact page includes the company’s details as well as a contact form. Homepage serves
        as the landing page and a preview of the four other pages.
